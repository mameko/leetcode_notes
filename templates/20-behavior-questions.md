# 20 Behavior Questions

这个其实很广泛：下面是一些notes作为参考， 觉得得结合公司的价值观来准备。最典型的就是亚麻的17条。可以在公司网上找。

Now that you have read till this point, I will let you know an internal secret - a set of questions which you will be asked no matter what.

These questions are your golden opportunity to impress them, prepare these questions well and it will set the direction and tone of the interview in your favor.

-Tell me something about yourself.

-Tell me about the last/current project you are working on .

-Tell me about the most interesting project you have worked on.

To address last 2 questions above, I would recommend providing interviewer with a very high level overview of your project(like you would explain your project to a 5 year old) and then pausing and asking them if they would like to dive into about any particular part of the project then go into technical details.

Again, please prepare these questions as thoroughly as you can, as it is the only guaranteed part of this whole interview exercise and completely in your control

心理医生话，所有bq问题最终可以归纳成4个问题：

1. Why this job
2. Why you
3. How you can help
4. What kind of person you are
