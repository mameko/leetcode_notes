## A Great Team and Winning Culture

Eventually, it all comes down to people. Creating a winning team and self-sustaining culture takes hard work, and there is no substitute for it. Teams do not win because they have a new stadium or the most attractive uniforms. Some of the best teams do not even have the most talented individual athletes. Teams succeed because they are disciplined, they work well together, they execute consistently and they have a passion to win.

### We Hire, Train and Retain Great, Diverse Employees

### We Build Teamwork, Loyalty and Morale

### We Maintain an Open, Entrepreneurial Meritocracy for All

### We Communicate Honestly, Clearly and Consistently

## Exceptional Client Service

Throughout our 200-year history, JPMorgan Chase has always been there for our constituents around the world. In the toughest of times when strong banks are needed the most, we never waver in our support, and we never lose sight of our main mission: serving our clients. Our job is to always do right by them and consistently strive not only to meet their needs but also to exceed their expectations and continually make it easy for clients to do business with us.

As much as any company on the planet, we are helping individuals, businesses of all sizes, governments, nonprofits and communities seize the opportunities of our times. We can do this because of the strong company we have built – global in reach, local in execution, with an impressive set of products and capabilities and a steadfast commitment to provide exceptional client service.

### We Focus on the Customer

### We Are Field and Client Driven; We Operate at the Local Level

### We Build World Class Franchises, Investing for the Long Term, to Serve Our Clients

## Operational Excellence

As important as strategy is, we have to execute to win. Execution involves every employee and every contact we have with customers. The devil is in the details. We must act quickly on problems; drive results, not just activities; and ensure detailed follow-up so that we meet our commitments.

### We Set the Highest Standards of Performance

### We Demand Financial Rigor and Risk Discipline; We Will Always Maintain a Fortress Balance Sheet

### We Strive for the Best Internal Governance and Controls

### We Act and Think Like Owners and Partners

### We Strive to Build and Maintain the Best, Most Efficient Systems and Operations

### We Are Disciplined in Everything We Do

### We Execute with Both Skill and Urgency

## A Commitment to Integrity, Fairness and Responsibility

In business, as in every other arena, ethical behavior does not just happen. It has to be cultivated and repeatedly affirmed throughout the organization. At JPMorgan Chase, acting with integrity is paramount– and it applies to every aspect of our company. Maintaining the highest standards of integrity involves faithfully meeting our commitments to all our constituents – customers, employees, the Board, shareholders, regulators – and to ourselves.

### We Will Not Compromise Our Integrity

### We Face Facts

### We Have Fortitude

### We Foster an Environment of Respect, Inclusiveness, Humanity and Humility
