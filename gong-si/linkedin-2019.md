# LinkedIn 2019 -01

其实2017年也面了一次，翻开笔记发现自己啥都没准备，真是作死。到现在才补...希望这次能拿到offer

L家特点：些边界比较tricky的题，DP会考，union find会考, trie不确定，string manipulation，树和LinkedList。也挺偏重数据结构design。听说onsite会有3轮sys design，真的很系统的公司。

Culture : [https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/03/11/linkedins-culture-of-transformation](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/03/11/linkedins-culture-of-transformation)

**Transformation**：culture of transform

1. Yourself, Leave LinkedIn a better professional than when you started
2. Company, Enable LinkedIn to realize its full potential
3. World, Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce

**Integrity :** We don't believe the ends justify the means, We expect employees to do the right thing.

**Collaboration** : We believe great ideas and inspirations come from everyone.

**Humor :** Don't wait for other people to make you laugh

**Result :** We set clear, actionable goals and have high expectations for our performance. If you can't mesure it you can't fix it.

Value :

Our member come first; relationships matter; be open honest and constructive; Demand excellence; take intelligent risks(learn from misstakes and move on); act like an owner

Some suggestions :

* Edge case show understanding what can go wrong. is something interviewers look for since it show that the candidate is able to adapt to real world situations.
* Even if the answer seems obvious, walking through a solution and verifying the assumptions being made before coding indicates experience in problem solving

Type of queston :

Binary Searches; Graph Algorithms; Backtracking algorithms; Recursive algorithms; Dynamic programming algorithms (rare)

Data structure :

HashMaps; HashSets; Binary Trees; Lists; Stacks; Custom Data Structures

**Use whole Name : eg. TreeNode not TNode; if the hack would not pass code review, won't pass LinkedIn's interview. Clean Code**

Candidates should discuss the following topics at the minimum:

1. The general idea behind the solution
2. The next step. What is it? Are there optimizations? Trade-offs?
3. Any potential blocks. What is blocking progress on the problem? If there’s no progress for 20 to 30 seconds, a candidate should explain what is causing the block.
4. Why certain code is being refactored if the candidate is changing things in their algorithm/code.
5. Manners of testing.

What we actually want to see is how the candidate thinks about and breaks down the problem, and then from there how well they can translate their ideas into an actual working solution.
